    "text": "Multi-Time Point Analysis (MTPA)\nThere are a wide-variety of options when deciding on an appropriate analysis strategy to use. It is almost impossible to cover every method. When reviewing papers, I feel bad because I inevitable bring up methods the authors did not include. This blog post adds to the already complicated landscape of time course analysis and add yet another tool to the pupillometry toolbox.\nI mostly do these blogs as an aid to help me better understand a method. I also hope it will help others.\nTo demonstrate MTPA I am going to use a simple example from data I collected as a postdoc at the University of Iowa. In this experiment, individuals (N=31) heard normal and 6-channel vocoded speech tokens (single words) and had to click on the correct picture. The vocoded condition should be harder, and in the figure below, you can see that it is–larger pupil size throughout the trial. Commonly, we would test significance by using a mass univariate approach (e.g., t-tests at each time point). Below we fit the time course data using Dale Barr’s clusterperm package with no corrections (with corrections nothing is significant). We see that there is a significant difference between the conditions that emerges starting around 800 ms and ends around 1900 ms. Using MTPA would we observe something different?\n\nlibrary(pacman)\n\n#devtools::install_github(\"dalejbarr/clusterperm\")\n\n\n\npacman::p_load(ERP, mnormt, fdrtool,\n               tidyverse, gridExtra, crayon, \n               boot, reshape2, ggthemes, \n               devtools,randomForest,leaps, pROC, tidyverse, here, gazer, clusterperm)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvo_mu &lt;- aov_by_bin(timebins1, timebins,   # clusterperm package\n  aggbaseline ~ vocoded + Error(subject))\n\nvo_mu$p_adjuct&lt;-p.adjust(vo_mu$p, method=\"none\")\n\nvo_mu_p=subset(vo_mu, vo_mu$p_adjuct &lt;= .05)\n\nknitr::kable(vo_mu_p)\n\n\n\ntimebins\neffect\nstat\np\np_adjuct\n\n\n\n800\nvocoded\n-6.729464\n0.0145280\n0.0145280\n\n\n900\nvocoded\n-7.085248\n0.0123675\n0.0123675\n\n\n1000\nvocoded\n-6.560462\n0.0156954\n0.0156954\n\n\n1100\nvocoded\n-8.561962\n0.0064854\n0.0064854\n\n\n1200\nvocoded\n-9.519850\n0.0043426\n0.0043426\n\n\n1300\nvocoded\n-9.398130\n0.0045664\n0.0045664\n\n\n1400\nvocoded\n-10.524933\n0.0028890\n0.0028890\n\n\n1500\nvocoded\n-11.652584\n0.0018560\n0.0018560\n\n\n1600\nvocoded\n-11.458565\n0.0020007\n0.0020007\n\n\n1700\nvocoded\n-11.172190\n0.0022369\n0.0022369\n\n\n1800\nvocoded\n-9.103745\n0.0051610\n0.0051610\n\n\n1900\nvocoded\n-5.687212\n0.0236102\n0.0236102"

    "text": "Before We Begin: A Summary\nBefore jumping into the MTPA analysis, I want to explain the method a little bit. The MTPA uses a random forest classifier in conjunction with cross validation to determine if there is a statistical difference in the pupil signal between conditions. This differs slightly from the approach outlined in (Mathôt & Vilotijević, 2022). In their approach, linear mixed models are used in conjunction with cross validation to pick samples with the highest Z value. In contrast, MTPA uses all time points. What MTPA does is calculate the area under the curve (AUC) along with 90% confidence intervals and averages them. Significance is determined by whether the CIs cross the .5 threshold. If it does not, there is a difference between conditions at that time point. Below I will outline specific steps needed to perform MTPA along with the R code."

In the matrix below, we see that category membership (Related (R) vs. Unrelated (U), or in our case normal and vocoded speech) is predicted from the signal at two time points. This is repeated until the last time point. In our example, this is the 27th time point, or 2500 ms. As a note, Yu et al. (2020) recommend 2 and stated other widths did not result in different conclusions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Define time point starts at -100 and ends at 2500\ntp &lt;- seq(-100,2500,by=100)\n\n### Start MTPA\n### Set parameters for MTPA\n# Consider 2 time points at each testing\nbinwidth = 2\n\n\nAfter this, we set our number of cross validations (100 times here), confidence interval, and our upper (number of time points (here it is 27) - banwidth (2) + 1)) and lower bounds, and create a matrix to store important model results.\n\n\nrcvnum &lt;- 100\n# Confidence interval\nci &lt;- c(0.05,0.95)\n# Set the upper and lower bound \n# number of timepoint - bin + 1\nupperbound &lt;- 27-binwidth+1\nlowerbound &lt;- 1\n# Store the results\nrst_vocode &lt;- matrix(NA,6,upperbound)\n\n\nFor every time point X CV, we fit a random forest model using the training data we created and use the test set for prediction. It is suggested that you sample 60~70% (two-thirds) of the data to train the model, and use the rest 30~40% (one-third) as your testing set. AUC and other important metrics are calculated for each time point and averaged together and stored in a matrix before going to the next time point. In our example we make sure that an equal number of normal speech and vocoded speech conditions are in each training and test sample.\n\n\n### Start MTPA model fitting with RF\nfor (i in lowerbound:upperbound){\n  # Record the AUC and CE\n  ceauc &lt;- matrix(NA,4,rcvnum)\n  # Start cross validation\n  for (k in 1:rcvnum){\n    # Set seed for reproducible research\n    set.seed(k)\n    # Training and Testing Data\n    idc_test &lt;- c(sample(1:30,5),sample(31:62,5))\n    idc_train &lt;- -idc_test\n    # Fit an RF model\n    fit &lt;- randomForest(Condition~.,data=vocode_wide[idc_train,c(2,3,(i+3):(i+3+binwidth-1))],importance = F)\n    yhat_test_prob &lt;- predict(fit,newdata = vocode_wide[idc_test,],type = \"prob\")[,2]\n    yhat_test_class &lt;- predict(fit,newdata = vocode_wide[idc_test,],type = \"class\")\n    # Record the results of RF fitting on Testing data\n    ce_test &lt;- mean(yhat_test_class!=vocode_wide[idc_test,]$Condition)\n    auc_test &lt;- pROC::auc(vocode_wide[idc_test,]$Condition,yhat_test_prob)\n    ceauc[2,k] &lt;- ce_test\n    ceauc[4,k] &lt;- auc_test\n  }\n  # Store the results of CV\n  rst_vocode[1,i] &lt;- mean(ceauc[2,])\n  rst_vocode[2,i] &lt;- mean(ceauc[4,])\n  rst_vocode[3,i] &lt;- quantile(ceauc[2,],probs = c(ci[1],ci[2]))[1]\n  rst_vocode[4,i] &lt;- quantile(ceauc[2,],probs = c(ci[1],ci[2]))[2]\n  rst_vocode[5,i] &lt;- quantile(ceauc[4,],probs = c(ci[1],ci[2]))[1]\n  rst_vocode[6,i] &lt;- quantile(ceauc[4,],probs = c(ci[1],ci[2]))[2]\n}\n# Reorganize the results, average all the time points that used to estimate the results\nvocodem &lt;- matrix(NA,6,27)\nvocodem[,1] &lt;- rst_vocode[,1]\nvocodem[,27] &lt;- rst_vocode[,26]\nfor (i in 1:(upperbound-1)){\n  tpi &lt;- i + 1\n  vocodem[1,tpi] &lt;- mean(rst_vocode[1,c((i+lowerbound-1):(i+lowerbound-1+binwidth-1))])\n  vocodem[2,tpi] &lt;- mean(rst_vocode[2,c((i+lowerbound-1):(i+lowerbound-1+binwidth-1))])\n  vocodem[3,tpi] &lt;- mean(rst_vocode[3,c((i+lowerbound-1):(i+lowerbound-1+binwidth-1))])\n  vocodem[4,tpi] &lt;- mean(rst_vocode[4,c((i+lowerbound-1):(i+lowerbound-1+binwidth-1))])\n  vocodem[5,tpi] &lt;- mean(rst_vocode[5,c((i+lowerbound-1):(i+lowerbound-1+binwidth-1))])\n  vocodem[6,tpi] &lt;- mean(rst_vocode[6,c((i+lowerbound-1):(i+lowerbound-1+binwidth-1))])\n}\nvocodem &lt;- as.data.frame(vocodem) # turn into df \ncolnames(vocodem) &lt;- paste0(\"Time\",1:27) #label time\nrow.names(vocodem) &lt;- c(\"CE\",\"AUC\",\"CE_l\",\"CE_u\",\"AUC_l\",\"AUC_u\") # label metrics\n\n\nFinally we transpose the matrix, put time in ms, and plot the AUC at each time point.

    "text": "Conclusions\nI have shown how to apply MTPA to pupillometric data. This method appears to be more powerful than a mass univariate approach, showing the whole time course as significant. It would be interesting to see how this compares to the method proposed by Mathôt & Vilotijević (2022). I would encourage anyone who is interested in applying this method to also check out Yu et al. (2020)’s excellent paper which this blog is based off of.\nPotential Limitations\nWhile this method looks promising, there does appear to be some limitations. First, it look looks like you can’t fit multilevel models. If you can, I suspect it is 1) computationally expensive and 2) not trivial. If anyone has an answer to this I would love to hear it. Second, it appears that you would have to conduct this test for each effect of interest rather then including everything in the model. This is something that Mathôt & Vilotijević (2022) also brings up in their paper. I will have to do some more investigating, but overall I am quite interested in learning more about ML applications to time course data like pupillometry.\n\nsessionInfo()\n\nR version 4.4.0 (2024-04-24)\nPlatform: aarch64-apple-darwin20\nRunning under: macOS Sonoma 14.4\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.4-arm64/Resources/lib/libRblas.0.dylib \nLAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.4-arm64/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib;  LAPACK version 3.12.0\n\nlocale:\n[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8\n\ntime zone: America/New_York\ntzcode source: internal\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n\nother attached packages:\n [1] clusterperm_0.1.0.9000 gazer_0.1              here_1.0.1            \n [4] pROC_1.18.5            leaps_3.1              randomForest_4.7-1.1  \n [7] devtools_2.4.5         usethis_2.2.3          ggthemes_5.1.0        \n[10] reshape2_1.4.4         boot_1.3-30            crayon_1.5.2          \n[13] gridExtra_2.3          lubridate_1.9.3        forcats_1.0.0         \n[16] stringr_1.5.1          dplyr_1.1.4            purrr_1.0.2           \n[19] readr_2.1.5            tidyr_1.3.1            tibble_3.2.1          \n[22] ggplot2_3.5.1          tidyverse_2.0.0        fdrtool_1.2.17        \n[25] mnormt_2.1.1           ERP_2.2                pacman_0.5.1          \n[28] papaja_0.1.2           tinylabels_0.2.4       knitr_1.46            \n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] remotes_2.5.0     rlang_1.1.4       magrittr_2.0.3    compiler_4.4.0   \n [5] png_0.1-8         vctrs_0.6.5       profvis_0.3.8     pkgconfig_2.0.3  \n [9] fastmap_1.1.1     backports_1.5.0   ellipsis_0.3.2    labeling_0.4.3   \n[13] effectsize_0.8.7  utf8_1.2.4        promises_1.3.0    rmarkdown_2.26   \n[17] sessioninfo_1.2.2 tzdb_0.4.0        bit_4.0.5         xfun_0.43        \n[21] cachem_1.0.8      jsonlite_1.8.8    later_1.3.2       broom_1.0.6      \n[25] irlba_2.3.5.1     parallel_4.4.0    R6_2.5.1          stringi_1.8.4    \n[29] pkgload_1.3.4     estimability_1.5  Rcpp_1.0.12       zoo_1.8-12       \n[33] parameters_0.21.6 httpuv_1.6.15     Matrix_1.7-0      splines_4.4.0    \n[37] timechange_0.3.0  tidyselect_1.2.1  rstudioapi_0.16.0 yaml_2.3.8       \n[41] miniUI_0.1.1.1    pkgbuild_1.4.4    lattice_0.22-6    plyr_1.8.9       \n[45] shiny_1.8.1.1     withr_3.0.0       bayestestR_0.13.2 coda_0.19-4.1    \n[49] evaluate_0.23     urlchecker_1.0.1  pillar_1.9.0      insight_0.19.10  \n[53] generics_0.1.3    vroom_1.6.5       rprojroot_2.0.4   hms_1.1.3        \n[57] munsell_0.5.1     scales_1.3.0      xtable_1.8-4      glue_1.7.0       \n[61] emmeans_1.10.1    tools_4.4.0       data.table_1.15.4 fs_1.6.4         \n[65] mvtnorm_1.2-4     grid_4.4.0        datawizard_0.10.0 colorspace_2.1-0 \n[69] Rmisc_1.5.1       cli_3.6.2         fansi_1.0.6       corpcor_1.6.10   \n[73] gtable_0.3.5      digest_0.6.35     farver_2.1.1      htmlwidgets_1.6.4\n[77] memoise_2.0.1     htmltools_0.5.8.1 lifecycle_1.0.4   mime_0.12        \n[81] bit64_4.0.5"

    "section": "",
    "text": "A core assumption underlying competitive-network models of word recognition is that in order for a word to be recognized, the representations of competing orthographically similar words must be inhibited. This inhibitory mechanism is revealed in the masked-priming lexical-decision task (LDT) when responses to orthographically similar word prime–target pairs are slower than orthographically different word prime–target pairs (i.e., inhibitory priming). In English, however, behavioral evidence for inhibitory priming has been mixed. In the present study, we utilized a physiological correlate of cognitive effort never before used in the masked-priming LDT, pupil size, to replicate and extend behavioral demonstrations of inhibitory effects (i.e., Nakayama, Sears, & Lupker, Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 34, 1236–1260, 2008, Exp. 1). Previous research had suggested that pupil size is a reliable indicator of cognitive load, making it a promising index of lexical inhibition. Our pupillometric data replicated and extended previous behavioral findings, in that inhibition was obtained for orthographically similar word prime–target pairs. However, our response time data provided only a partial replication of Nakayama et al. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 34, 1236–1260, 2008. These results provide converging lines of evidence that inhibition operates in word recognition and that pupillometry is a useful addition to word recognition researchers’ toolbox."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Presenting information in a perceptually disfluent format sometimes enhances memory. Recent work examining 1 type of perceptual disfluency manipulation, Sans Forgetica typeface, has yielded discrepant findings; some studies find support for the idea that the disfluent typeface improves memory whereas others do not. The current study examined a boundary condition that determines when disfluency is and is not beneficial to learning to explore this discrepancy. Specifically, we investigated whether knowledge about an upcoming test (high test expectancy) versus not (low test expectancy) helps clarify when mnemonic benefits arise for perceptually disfluent stimuli. In Experiment 1 (preregistered, N = 231), we found that Sans Forgetica is a memory-improving desirable difficulty, but only when there was no expectation of a final test. In Experiment 2 (preregistered, N = 232), we conceptually replicated the Sans Forgetica effect using a cued-recall test. In Experiment 3 (preregistered, N = 232), we ruled out a time-on-task explanation while replicating the results of Experiment 2. Though these data provide some evidence of San Forgetica’s mnemonic benefits, caution should be taken in interpreting these results. Not only were the effect sizes moderate, but low test expectancy may not be realistically achievable in actual educational contexts. Though more research is warranted, we echo our prior arguments that students wanting to remember more and forget less should stick to other, more empirically supported desirable difficulties."

The development of remote webcam-based eye-tracking technology, integrated with web-based crowdsourcing studies, may be a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to laboratory-based eye-tracking methods. However, research is needed to evaluate the utility of remote eye-tracking methods.\n\n\n\nThis study aimed to detail the process of designing a remote webcam-based eye-tracking experiment and provide data on associations between participant characteristics and the outcomes of experiment completion.\n\n\n\nA total of 2023 young adult (aged 18-34 years) cigarette smokers in the United States were recruited to complete a web-based survey that included a 90-second remote eye-tracking experiment that examined attention to e-cigarette marketing materials. Primary outcome measures assessed the completion of the remote eye-tracking experiment—specifically, experiment initiated versus not initiated, experiment completed versus not completed, and usable versus nonusable eye-tracking data generated. Multivariable logistic regressions examined the associations between outcome measures and participants’ sociodemographic backgrounds, tobacco use history, and electronic devices (mobile vs desktop) used during the experiment.\n\n\n\nStudy recruitment began on April 14, 2022, and ended on May 3, 2022. Of the 2023 survey participants, 1887 (93.28%) initiated the experiment, and 777 (38.41%) completed the experiment. Of the 777 participants who completed the experiment, 381 (49%) generated usable data. Results from the full regression models show that non-Hispanic Black participants (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.64, 95% CI 0.45-0.91) were less likely to complete the eye-tracking experiment than non-Hispanic White participants. In addition, female (vs male) participants (AOR 1.46, 95% CI 1.01-2.11), those currently using (vs not using) e-cigarettes (AOR 2.08, 95% CI 1.13-3.82), and those who used mobile (vs desktop) devices (AOR 5.10, 95% CI 3.05-8.52) were more likely to generate usable eye-tracking data.\n\n\n\nYoung adult participants were willing to try remote eye-tracking technology, and nearly half of those who completed the experiment generated usable eye-tracking data (381/777, 49%).

While evidence is mixed, recent claims suggest that placing materials in Sans Forgetica, a perceptually difficult-to-process typeface, has positive impacts on student learning. Given the weak evidence for other similar perceptual disfluency effects, we examined the mnemonic effects of Sans Forgetica more closely in comparison to other learning strategies across three preregistered experiments. In Experiment 1, participants studied weakly related cue-target pairs with targets presented in either Sans Forgetica or with missing letters (e.g., cue: G_RL, the generation effect). Cued recall performance showed a robust effect of generation, but no Sans Forgetica memory benefit. In Experiment 2, participants read an educational passage about ground water with select sentences presented in either Sans Forgetica typeface, yellow pre-highlighting, or unmodified. Cued recall for select words was better for pre-highlighted information than an unmodified pure reading condition. Critically, presenting sentences in Sans Forgetica did not elevate cued recall compared to an unmodified pure reading condition or a pre-highlighted condition. In Experiment 3, individuals did not have better discriminability for Sans Forgetica relative to a fluent condition in an old-new recognition test. Our findings suggest that Sans Forgetica really is forgettable."

    "text": "Students’ judgements of their own learning often exceed their knowledge on a given topic. One source of this pervasive overconfidence is fluency, the perceived ease with which information is acquired. Though effects of fluency on metacognitive judgments have been explored by manipulating relatively simple stimuli such as font style, few studies have explored the effects of fluency on more complex forms of learning encountered in educational settings, such as learning from lectures. The present study manipulated the fluency of a 31-min video-recorded lecture, and measured its effects on both perceived and actual learning. In the fluent condition, the instructor used non-verbal gestures, voice dynamics, mobility about the space, and appropriate pauses. In the disfluent condition, the same instructor read directly from notes, hunched over a podium, rarely made eye contact, used few non-verbal gestures, spoke in monotone pitch, and took irregular and awkward pauses. Though participants rated the fluent instructor significantly higher than the disfluent instructor on measures of teaching effectiveness and estimated that they had learned more of the material, actual learning between the two groups did not differ as assessed by a memory test over the lecture contents given immediately (Experiment 1) or after a 1-day delay (Experiment 2). This counterintuitive result reveals an “illusion of learning” due to fluency in lecture-based learning, a very common form of instruction."

    "section": "",
    "text": "When exposed to words presented under perceptually disfluent conditions (e.g., words written in Haettenschweiler font), participants have difficulty initially recognizing the words. Those same words, though, may be better remembered later than words presented in standard type font. This counterintuitive finding is referred to as the disfluency effect. Evidence for this disfluency effect, however, has been mixed, suggesting possible moderating factors. Using a recognition memory task, level of disfluency was examined as a moderating factor across three experiments using a novel cursive manipulation that varied on degree of legibility (easy-to-read cursive vs. hard-to-read cursive). In addition, list type and retention interval between study and test were manipulated. Across all three experiments, cursive words engendered better memory than type-print words. This memory effect persisted across varied list designs (blocked vs. mixed) and a longer (24-hour) retention interval. A small-scale meta-analysis across the three experiments suggested that the cursive disfluency effect is moderated by level of disfluency: easy-to-read cursive words tended to be better remembered than hard-to-read cursive words. Taken together, these results challenge extant accounts of the disfluency effect. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed."

    "section": "",
    "text": "When exposed to words presented under perceptually disfluent conditions (e.g., words written in Haettenschweiler font), participants have difficulty initially recognizing the words. Those same words, though, may be better remembered later than words presented in standard type font. This counterintuitive finding is referred to as the disfluency effect. Evidence for this disfluency effect, however, has been mixed, suggesting possible moderating factors. Using a recognition memory task, level of disfluency was examined as a moderating factor across three experiments using a novel cursive manipulation that varied on degree of legibility (easy-to-read cursive vs. hard-to-read cursive). In addition, list type and retention interval between study and test were manipulated. Across all three experiments, cursive words engendered better memory than type-print words. This memory effect persisted across varied list designs (blocked vs. mixed) and a longer (24-hour) retention interval. A small-scale meta-analysis across the three experiments suggested that the cursive disfluency effect is moderated by level of disfluency: easy-to-read cursive words tended to be better remembered than hard-to-read cursive words. Taken together, these results challenge extant accounts of the disfluency effect. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed."

    "text": "The stigma of seeking counseling and negative attitudes about counseling are primary barriers to its use. In the only known study examining the utility of attending a group counseling session to ameliorate stigma (no control group), participation was associated with reductions in self-stigma (Wade et al., 2011). Self-affirmation interventions have shown promising results in reducing stigma and promoting positive expectations about counseling, but no research has examined its effects on a counseling session. In the present, two-part study, 172 college students who had previously completed an online screening survey, including measures of stigma, participated in a single session of group counseling at a mental health clinic. Upon arrival, participants completed a self-affirmation intervention before viewing psychoeducation (n = 66; 12 groups) or only viewed psychoeducation (n = 72; 14 groups); both groups then completed a session of group counseling. After, participants completed these same measures along with measures of group relationships. The remaining participants (n = 34; 7 groups) viewed psychoeducation and completed the same stigma measures before being informed of randomization to the waitlist-control condition. Our results replicate and extend findings from Wade et al. (2011): completing a single session of group counseling reduced self-stigma and promoted positive attitudes toward counseling. Further, completing self-affirmation reduced post-session perceptions of public stigma. Self-affirmation had no impact on group relationships. Overall, findings suggest the utility of offering a “try-out” session of group counseling as a stigma-reduction intervention; preceding with a brief self-affirmation intervention provides further benefits by reducing perceptions of public stigma."

The Iowa Test of Consonant Perception (ITCP) attempts to solve this. It is a proportionally balanced phonemic word recognition task designed to assess perception of the initial consonant of monosyllabic consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) words. The ITCP consists of 120 sampled CVC words. Words were recorded from four different talkers (two female) and uniformly sampled from all four quadrants of the vowel space to control for coarticulation. Response choices on each trial are balanced to equate difficulty and sample a single phonetic feature. This study evaluated the psychometric properties of ITCP by examining reliability (test-retest) and validity in a sample of online normal-hearing participants. Ninety-eight participants completed two sessions of the ITCP along with standardized tests of words and sentence in noise (CNC words and AzBio sentences). The ITCP showed good test-retest reliability and convergent validity with two popular tests presented in noise.

Using Bayesian meta-analytic tools, we further found little to no evidence that the observed variability can be explained by analysts’ prior beliefs, expertise, or the perceived quality of their analyses.

We examined whether students’ achievement goals, independent of academic achievement, predicted beliefs about learning and endorsement of study strategies. We administered Hartwig and Dunlosky’s survey, along with the Achievement Goals Questionnaire [Elliot, A. J., & McGregor, H. A. (2001). A 2 × 2 achievement goal framework.

Similar to results by Hartwig and Dunlosky, we found that high-performing students (relative to low-performing students) were more likely to endorse self-testing, less likely to cram, and more likely to plan a study schedule ahead of time. Independent of achievement, however, achievement goals were stronger predictors of certain study behaviours. In particular, avoidance goals (e.g., fear of failure) coincided with increased use of cramming and the tendency to be driven by impending deadlines. Results suggest that individual differences in student achievement, as well as the underlying reasons for achievement, are important predictors of students’ approaches to studying."

In Experiment 3, when participants learned Swahili words with only one type of cue (pictures or English translations) and then estimated which one would be more effective for learning, the majority of participants believed pictures would be more effective regardless of whether they had experienced those cues during learning. Experiment 4 showed the same results when participants had experienced neither type of cue during a learning phase.

Using a different sample of stroke patients (N = 128) and four language deficit measures (aphasia severity, picture naming, and composite scores for speech production and semantic cognition), we examined tract disconnection and lesion load in three white matter tracts that have been implicated in language processing: arcuate fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. We did not find any consistent evidence that binary tract disconnection was more strongly associated with language impairment over and above lesion load, though individual deficit measures differed with respect to whether lesion load or tract disconnection was the stronger predictor. Given the mixed findings, we suggest caution when using such indirect estimates of structural white matter integrity, and direct individual measurements (for example, using diffusion weighted imaging) should be preferred when they are available.

It is not clear whether the same contrast applies to the broader set of taxonomic relations, which are also based on shared sensory-motor features. In this study we tested cognitive control requirements of retrieving taxonomic and thematic knowledge using a physiological measure of cognitive effort: pupil dilation. Participants completed a semantic relatedness judgement task that manipulated semantic type (thematic vs. taxonomic) and relatedness strength (high vs. low) of word pairs. Cognitive control in the similarity task was examined using task-evoked pupillary responses (TEPRs), as well as standard behavioral measures (reaction times and accuracy). Compared with high-strength relations, low-strength semantic relations elicited larger TERPs, slower reaction times, and lower accuracy, consistent with higher control demands. Compared to thematic relations, taxonomic relations also elicited larger TERPs and slower reaction times, suggesting that retrieving taxonomic relations required more cognitive effort. Critically, our pupillometric data indicated that controlled processing was particularly important for low-strength taxonomic pairs rather than low-strength thematic pairs.

This study examined age-related differences in effortful listening by recording changes in the task-evoked pupil response (TEPR; a physiological marker of listening effort) both at the level of sentence processing and over the entire course of a listening task. A total of 65 (32 young adults, 33 older adults) participants performed a speech recognition task in the presence of a competing talker, while moment-to-moment changes in pupil size were continuously monitored. Participants were also administered the Vanderbilt Fatigue Scale, a questionnaire assessing daily life listening-related fatigue within four domains (social, cognitive, emotional, physical). Normalized TEPRs were overall larger and more steeply rising and falling around the peak in the older versus the young adult group during sentence processing. Additionally, mean TEPRs over the course of the listening task were more stable in the older versus the young adult group, consistent with a more sustained recruitment of compensatory attentional resources to maintain task performance. No age-related differences were found in terms of total daily life listening-related fatigue; however, older adults reported higher scores than young adults within the social domain. Overall, this study provides evidence for qualitatively distinct patterns of physiological arousal between young and older adults consistent with age-related upregulation in resource allocation during listening. A more detailed understanding of age-related changes in the subjective and physiological mechanisms that underlie effortful listening will ultimately help to address complex communication needs in aging listeners."

Differences in response latencies between related word-pair conditions and unrelated word-pair conditions (i.e., difference score confidence interval is greater than zero) will allow quantifying evidence for semantic priming, whereas improvements in model fit with the addition of a random intercept for language will provide support for variability in semantic priming across languages."

Differences in response latencies between related word-pair conditions and unrelated word-pair conditions (i.e., difference score confidence interval is greater than zero) will allow quantifying evidence for semantic priming, whereas improvements in model fit with the addition of a random intercept for language will provide support for variability in semantic priming across languages."

    "text": "Thanks for stopping by!\nI am currently Director of the Human Neuroscience Lab at Boston College. My research program investigates the cognitive and neurological underpinnings of language processing. I am primarily interested in the mechanisms underlying visual word recognition and speech perception. On the weekends, I spend time with my other love: human memory. In this area, I am interested in semantics, metacognition/metamemory, and desirable difficulties.\nMy philosophy is that cognition is best understood by looking at both behavior and the brain. To get a better understanding of cognition I use a multi-method approach that involves using standard behavioral measurements (e.g., reaction times), eye-tracking, neuroimaging, and physiological and nuero-physiological indices (e.g., pupillometry,EEG/sEEG).\nMost importantly, my research is conducted according to the principles of open science. In my research, I promote open science practices by making all my work accessible and reproducible."

The function below takes a list of files called file_list and merges all the files together, appends a subject column, creates a trial column using the USER column (GazePoint only allows messages through this channel), creates a time variable (in milliseconds). In the merge_gazepoint function the trail_msg argument requires users to denote a message used in the USER column that references the start of the trial–in our case the START message denotes the start of a new trial. This is a solution by Matt Robinson, but there are other ways one could extract the trial number. What I have done in the past is append a message with the trial iteration (e.g., START_1) in Python and use the separate function to get the trial number.\n\n# A \"monocular mean\" averages both eyes together.

This relies on the saccades package (https://github.com/tmalsburg/saccades) which uses a velocity based measure based on X,Y coordinates to find blinks. Once we find the blinks we can change the pupil size at that time point as NA and interpolate over it.\nAs a note, the GazePoint does not seem to sample consistently. In this case, it samples every 16 or 17 ms. This is a problem for some other blink detection measures (e.g., the noise based pupil function). One soultion would be to downsample the data at the onset so there is consistancy from sample to sample.\n\nblinks_merge&lt;- blink_detect(pdb)\n\n blinks &lt;- blinks_merge %&gt;%\n        dplyr::group_by(grp = cumsum(!is.na(startend))) %&gt;%\n        dplyr::mutate(Label = replace(startend, first(startend) == 'start', 'start')) %&gt;% #extends the start message forward until end message\n        dplyr::ungroup() %&gt;%\n        # label blinks as 1\n        dplyr::select(subject, trial, time, x, y, pupil, message, tone,  Label, -grp)\n \n \n blinks_data &lt;- blinks  %&gt;%\n        dplyr::mutate(blink=ifelse(!is.na(Label), 1, 0), pupil=ifelse(blink==1 | pupil==0, NA, pupil))%&gt;%\n        dplyr::ungroup()%&gt;%\n        dplyr::select(subject, time, trial, pupil, x, y, trial, message, tone, blink, -Label)\n\nHere is a look at the trials containing blinks:\n\nblinks_data %&gt;% \n  filter(blink==1) %&gt;%\n  head()%&gt;%\n  knitr::kable()\n\n\n\nsubject\ntime\ntrial\npupil\nx\ny\nmessage\ntone\nblink\n\n\n\n13\n2167\n10\nNA\n0.9364\n1.95015\nPOSTTONE\nlo\n1\n\n\n13\n2183\n10\nNA\n0.9364\n1.95015\nPOSTTONE\nlo\n1\n\n\n13\n2199\n10\nNA\n0.9364\n1.95015\nPOSTTONE\nlo\n1\n\n\n13\n2216\n10\nNA\n0.9364\n1.95015\nPOSTTONE\nlo\n1\n\n\n13\n0\n11\nNA\n0.9364\n1.95015\nSTART\nhi\n1\n\n\n13\n16\n11\nNA\n0.9364\n1.95015\nSTART\nhi\n1\n\n\n\n\n\nExtending Blinks\nI am extending blinks 100 ms forward and backward in time.\n\n\n\nInterpolate Blinks\nHere let’s linearly interpolate the blinks and then smooth the data using a 5-point moving average.\n\n# Smooth and Interpolate\nsmooth_interp &lt;- smooth_interpolate_pupil(pup_extend, pupil=\"pupil\", extendpupil=\"extendpupil\", extendblinks=TRUE, step.first=\"smooth\", maxgap=Inf, type=\"linear\", hz=60, n=5)"

    "text": "An article by Reilly et al. (2019) raised some important questions/issues for the field of pupillometry. One issue that has been bothering me as of late (hence the post) pertains to objectively defining a time window to look at. Although some commonalities exist across the literature, there is no uniform standard for isolating a peak range or delineating the width of this window. In this blog post I present a method we can use to address this issue. To do so, I will be using the example data set from the gazeR package (Geller et al. (n.d.)). This data comes from a lexical decison experiment where participants judged the lexicality of cursive and type-print stimuli."

Some will preform seperate statistical tests at each time point (via t tests, LMMs, ANOVAs, regressions, what have you), or they just ignore time altogether and aggregate the data and perfrom analyses on the mean and max. I do not like these approaches for a few reasons:\n\nThere is a trade-off between power and temporal resolution (smaller time bins) and introducesbias in selection of time bins/windows. There is also the issues of multiple comparisons and autocorrelation\nDoes not take into account individual differences\n\nI wanted to highlight a method I believe is a good alternative: cluster-based permutation tests (henceforth CPT)"

    "text": "CPT\nLet’s first look at a graph of the data.\n\n\nError in `select()`:\n! Can't select columns that don't exist.\n✖ Column `X1` doesn't exist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this, we might be tempted to declare a significant difference arisisng ~1500-2500 ms. However, we cannot rely on the graphical analysis and we need a statistical test to be able to affirm that this observation is caused by diffierntial effort between the two scripts.\nPermuation cluster analysis is a technique that is becoming increasingly popular, especially in the cognitvie neuropsychology domain to analyze MEG-EEG (Maris & Oostenveld, 2007). While there exists a number of cluster analysis functions in MNE-Python (Gramfort et al., 2014) and Matlab’s FieldTrip (Oostenveld et al., 2011), what I want to show you is how you can do this analysis in R. The implementation of CPT has not been widely used in pupillometry research. I will hopefully show you that it can be a very useful tool to have in your aresenal.\nBefore I show you how to apply this method, I want to briefly go over the CPT method. The CPT is a data-driven method which increases power and controls for Type I errors across multiple comparisons (exatcly what we need when looking at pupil changes across the time course!). The clustering method involves conducting dependent-sample t-tests for every data point (condition by time). In the first step, adjacent data points that cross the mass-univariate significance threshold (p &lt; .05) are combined to create a cluster. The sum of the t-statistic (or F) are calculated and form the basis for the cluster level statistic. In the second step, a surrogate null-distribution is created by first randomly assigning one of the two conditions within subjects (this is done n times) and retaining the cluster statistic for each randomization. In the third and final step, the cluster level statistic of the real comparison is compared against the null distribution, with clusters falling in the highest or lowest 2.5% considered to be significant.\nWhile writing this blog post, I saw that Dale Barr presented on CPT in the context of eye-tracking. I figured I would take this opportunity to test out the packages he created.\n\ndevtools::install_github(\"dalejbarr/exchangr\")\ndevtools::install_github(\"dalejbarr/clusterperm\")\nlibrary(exchangr)\nlibrary(clusterperm)\n\nThe ‘clusterperm’ package has a pretty nifty aov_by_bin function. If we applied a multlipe comparison correction (e.g., holm) to this data.\n\ncur2 &lt;- aov_by_bin(agg_subject, timebins,   # clusterperm package\n  aggbaseline ~ script + Error(subject))\n\ncur2$p_adjuct&lt;-p.adjust(cur2$p, method=\"holm\")\n\ncur2_p=subset(cur2, cur2$p_adjuct &lt;= .05)\n\nknitr::kable(cur2_p)\n\n\n\ntimebins\neffect\nstat\np\np_adjuct\n\n\n\n2000\nscript\n12.97351\n0.0008456\n0.0202952\n\n\n2100\nscript\n17.08613\n0.0001720\n0.0044723\n\n\n2200\nscript\n14.51092\n0.0004587\n0.0114670\n\n\n2300\nscript\n12.96859\n0.0008473\n0.0202952\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does it compare to CPT?\n\norig &lt;- detect_clusters_by_effect(cur2, effect, timebins, stat, p)\n\nknitr::kable(orig)\n\n\n\neffect\nb0\nb1\nsign\ncms\n\n\n\nscript\n0\n100\n1\n10.121215\n\n\nscript\n900\n1000\n-1\n8.756152\n\n\nscript\n1900\n2500\n1\n82.198279\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like the multiple comparison correction is less sensitive.\nWait! we do not have p-values!!! Where are the damn p-values!? What is life? How am I suppose to make an informed decison? What is cool about Dale’s R package is that it has a permutation function that allows you to build the null model and obtain those coveted p-values.\n\ndat_prec &lt;- nest(agg_subject, -subject, -script)\n\nnhds_prec &lt;- cluster_nhds(\n  100, dat_prec, timebins,\n  aggbaseline ~ script + Error(subject),\n  shuffle_each, script, subject) # only use 100 permutations.

I feel much better now!\nFrom this graph we can see that there is one signifcant cluster: from 1900-2500 ms. If you were using this as a more explortatory approach (which I think we should), we know have a time period to look at where we can perform more common tests (e.g., max or mean during that time period). We could alternatively make the inference that a difference between cursive and print-type arises somewhere around 1900-2500 ms.\n\n\nError in `select()`:\n! Can't select columns that don't exist.\n✖ Column `X1` doesn't exist."

    "text": "Thoughts\nThere are some misunderstandings users should be made aware of when it comes to CPT (see Sassenhagen & Draschkow, 2019) for a nice discussion). If we want to ask more specific questions (i.e., at what exact time points effects arise), CPT with a cluster mass correction is not the method to use. We can only be certain that a difference exists; we cannot make claims about whether individual time points show an effect with a given error rate. I think this is more of an issue for M/EEG than pupillometry though. The pupillary signal is very slow.\nOverall, I think CPT can be a very useful tool in determing an appropiate time range to look at, and can even lead to more powerful inferences. Further, the use of CPT obviates the need for multiple comparisons and autocorrelation corrections. However, it does have issues. For instance, it cannot take into account subject and item variability. In addition, it is not able to tell you where within the cluster there is a difference only that there is a difference. And finally, when power is low, clusters may include many false postive time points (Fields & Kuperberg, 2019).\nIn my next blog, I will discuss applying generalized additive mixed modeling to your pupillometry data. I think it might be the perfect soultion!"

It is required of all first-year students in the psychology Ph.D. program. The purpose of this course is to introduce students to statistics with an emphasis on modeling. We cover many of the most widely applied data analysis models in psychology. We focus on data visualization, effect size estimation and interpretation, and using statistical analysis to inform scientific research questions. We develop practical skills related to data management, reproducibility, and statistical programming through the use of R, R Markdown/Quarto, and Github.\n\n            \n                \n                \n                 Fall 2022\n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Advances in Statistical Methods and Research Practices in Psychology \n                \n            \n            \n                PSY505 | \n                Princeton University\n                \n            \n            Psychological methods keep evolving: psychology researchers constantly adopt new statistical methods, computational tools, and research practices. This course introduces the latest advances in research methods in psychological science through a series of lectures, tutorials, and seminars. Lectures are generally given by a guest speaker who introduces methodological and statistical issues relevant to psychology research. Students engage in a group discussion with the speaker before the lecture. Tutorials provide students with the necessary skills to build reproducible and transparent research programs. For instance, students learn how to use R, RMarkdown and Git/GitHub, or how to preregister their studies.
