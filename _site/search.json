    "text": "Multi-Time Point Analysis (MTPA)\nThere are a wide-variety of options when deciding on an appropriate analysis strategy to use. It is almost impossible to cover every method. When reviewing papers, I feel bad because I inevitable bring up methods the authors did not include. This blog post adds to the already complicated landscape of time course analysis and add yet another tool to the pupillometry toolbox.\nI mostly do these blogs as an aid to help me better understand a method. I also hope it will help others.\nTo demonstrate MTPA I am going to use a simple example from data I collected as a postdoc at the University of Iowa. In this experiment, individuals (N=31) heard normal and 6-channel vocoded speech tokens (single words) and had to click on the correct picture. The vocoded condition should be harder, and in the figure below, you can see that it is–larger pupil size throughout the trial. Commonly, we would test significance by using a mass univariate approach (e.g., t-tests at each time point). Below we fit the time course data using Dale Barr’s clusterperm package with no corrections (with corrections nothing is significant). We see that there is a significant difference between the conditions that emerges starting around 800 ms and ends around 1900 ms. Using MTPA would we observe something different?\n\nlibrary(pacman)\n\n#devtools::install_github(\"dalejbarr/clusterperm\")\n\n\n\npacman::p_load(ERP, mnormt, fdrtool,\n               tidyverse, gridExtra, crayon, \n               boot, reshape2, ggthemes, \n               devtools,randomForest,leaps, pROC, tidyverse, here, gazer, clusterperm)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvo_mu &lt;- aov_by_bin(timebins1, timebins,   # clusterperm package\n  aggbaseline ~ vocoded + Error(subject))\n\nvo_mu$p_adjuct&lt;-p.adjust(vo_mu$p, method=\"none\")\n\nvo_mu_p=subset(vo_mu, vo_mu$p_adjuct &lt;= .05)\n\nknitr::kable(vo_mu_p)\n\n\n\ntimebins\neffect\nstat\np\np_adjuct\n\n\n\n800\nvocoded\n-6.729464\n0.0145280\n0.0145280\n\n\n900\nvocoded\n-7.085248\n0.0123675\n0.0123675\n\n\n1000\nvocoded\n-6.560462\n0.0156954\n0.0156954\n\n\n1100\nvocoded\n-8.561962\n0.0064854\n0.0064854\n\n\n1200\nvocoded\n-9.519850\n0.0043426\n0.0043426\n\n\n1300\nvocoded\n-9.398130\n0.0045664\n0.0045664\n\n\n1400\nvocoded\n-10.524933\n0.0028890\n0.0028890\n\n\n1500\nvocoded\n-11.652584\n0.0018560\n0.0018560\n\n\n1600\nvocoded\n-11.458565\n0.0020007\n0.0020007\n\n\n1700\nvocoded\n-11.172190\n0.0022369\n0.0022369\n\n\n1800\nvocoded\n-9.103745\n0.0051610\n0.0051610\n\n\n1900\nvocoded\n-5.687212\n0.0236102\n0.0236102"

    "text": "Before We Begin: A Summary\nBefore jumping into the MTPA analysis, I want to explain the method a little bit. The MTPA uses a random forest classifier in conjunction with cross validation to determine if there is a statistical difference in the pupil signal between conditions. This differs slightly from the approach outlined in (Mathôt & Vilotijević, 2022). In their approach, linear mixed models are used in conjunction with cross validation to pick samples with the highest Z value. In contrast, MTPA uses all time points. What MTPA does is calculate the area under the curve (AUC) along with 90% confidence intervals and averages them. Significance is determined by whether the CIs cross the .5 threshold. If it does not, there is a difference between conditions at that time point. Below I will outline specific steps needed to perform MTPA along with the R code."

In the matrix below, we see that category membership (Related (R) vs. Unrelated (U), or in our case normal and vocoded speech) is predicted from the signal at two time points. This is repeated until the last time point. In our example, this is the 27th time point, or 2500 ms. As a note, Yu et al. (2020) recommend 2 and stated other widths did not result in different conclusions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Define time point starts at -100 and ends at 2500\ntp &lt;- seq(-100,2500,by=100)\n\n### Start MTPA\n### Set parameters for MTPA\n# Consider 2 time points at each testing\nbinwidth = 2\n\n\nAfter this, we set our number of cross validations (100 times here), confidence interval, and our upper (number of time points (here it is 27) - banwidth (2) + 1)) and lower bounds, and create a matrix to store important model results.\n\n\nrcvnum &lt;- 100\n# Confidence interval\nci &lt;- c(0.05,0.95)\n# Set the upper and lower bound \n# number of timepoint - bin + 1\nupperbound &lt;- 27-binwidth+1\nlowerbound &lt;- 1\n# Store the results\nrst_vocode &lt;- matrix(NA,6,upperbound)\n\n\nFor every time point X CV, we fit a random forest model using the training data we created and use the test set for prediction. It is suggested that you sample 60~70% (two-thirds) of the data to train the model, and use the rest 30~40% (one-third) as your testing set. AUC and other important metrics are calculated for each time point and averaged together and stored in a matrix before going to the next time point. In our example we make sure that an equal number of normal speech and vocoded speech conditions are in each training and test sample.\n\n\n### Start MTPA model fitting with RF\nfor (i in lowerbound:upperbound){\n  # Record the AUC and CE\n  ceauc &lt;- matrix(NA,4,rcvnum)\n  # Start cross validation\n  for (k in 1:rcvnum){\n    # Set seed for reproducible research\n    set.seed(k)\n    # Training and Testing Data\n    idc_test &lt;- c(sample(1:30,5),sample(31:62,5))\n    idc_train &lt;- -idc_test\n    # Fit an RF model\n    fit &lt;- randomForest(Condition~.,data=vocode_wide[idc_train,c(2,3,(i+3):(i+3+binwidth-1))],importance = F)\n    yhat_test_prob &lt;- predict(fit,newdata = vocode_wide[idc_test,],type = \"prob\")[,2]\n    yhat_test_class &lt;- predict(fit,newdata = vocode_wide[idc_test,],type = \"class\")\n    # Record the results of RF fitting on Testing data\n    ce_test &lt;- mean(yhat_test_class!=vocode_wide[idc_test,]$Condition)\n    auc_test &lt;- pROC::auc(vocode_wide[idc_test,]$Condition,yhat_test_prob)\n    ceauc[2,k] &lt;- ce_test\n    ceauc[4,k] &lt;- auc_test\n  }\n  # Store the results of CV\n  rst_vocode[1,i] &lt;- mean(ceauc[2,])\n  rst_vocode[2,i] &lt;- mean(ceauc[4,])\n  rst_vocode[3,i] &lt;- quantile(ceauc[2,],probs = c(ci[1],ci[2]))[1]\n  rst_vocode[4,i] &lt;- quantile(ceauc[2,],probs = c(ci[1],ci[2]))[2]\n  rst_vocode[5,i] &lt;- quantile(ceauc[4,],probs = c(ci[1],ci[2]))[1]\n  rst_vocode[6,i] &lt;- quantile(ceauc[4,],probs = c(ci[1],ci[2]))[2]\n}\n# Reorganize the results, average all the time points that used to estimate the results\nvocodem &lt;- matrix(NA,6,27)\nvocodem[,1] &lt;- rst_vocode[,1]\nvocodem[,27] &lt;- rst_vocode[,26]\nfor (i in 1:(upperbound-1)){\n  tpi &lt;- i + 1\n  vocodem[1,tpi] &lt;- mean(rst_vocode[1,c((i+lowerbound-1):(i+lowerbound-1+binwidth-1))])\n  vocodem[2,tpi] &lt;- mean(rst_vocode[2,c((i+lowerbound-1):(i+lowerbound-1+binwidth-1))])\n  vocodem[3,tpi] &lt;- mean(rst_vocode[3,c((i+lowerbound-1):(i+lowerbound-1+binwidth-1))])\n  vocodem[4,tpi] &lt;- mean(rst_vocode[4,c((i+lowerbound-1):(i+lowerbound-1+binwidth-1))])\n  vocodem[5,tpi] &lt;- mean(rst_vocode[5,c((i+lowerbound-1):(i+lowerbound-1+binwidth-1))])\n  vocodem[6,tpi] &lt;- mean(rst_vocode[6,c((i+lowerbound-1):(i+lowerbound-1+binwidth-1))])\n}\nvocodem &lt;- as.data.frame(vocodem) # turn into df \ncolnames(vocodem) &lt;- paste0(\"Time\",1:27) #label time\nrow.names(vocodem) &lt;- c(\"CE\",\"AUC\",\"CE_l\",\"CE_u\",\"AUC_l\",\"AUC_u\") # label metrics\n\n\nFinally we transpose the matrix, put time in ms, and plot the AUC at each time point.

    "text": "Conclusions\nI have shown how to apply MTPA to pupillometric data. This method appears to be more powerful than a mass univariate approach, showing the whole time course as significant. It would be interesting to see how this compares to the method proposed by Mathôt & Vilotijević (2022). I would encourage anyone who is interested in applying this method to also check out Yu et al. (2020)’s excellent paper which this blog is based off of.\nPotential Limitations\nWhile this method looks promising, there does appear to be some limitations. First, it look looks like you can’t fit multilevel models. If you can, I suspect it is 1) computationally expensive and 2) not trivial. If anyone has an answer to this I would love to hear it. Second, it appears that you would have to conduct this test for each effect of interest rather then including everything in the model. This is something that Mathôt & Vilotijević (2022) also brings up in their paper. I will have to do some more investigating, but overall I am quite interested in learning more about ML applications to time course data like pupillometry.\n\nsessionInfo()\n\nR version 4.4.0 (2024-04-24)\nPlatform: aarch64-apple-darwin20\nRunning under: macOS Sonoma 14.4\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.4-arm64/Resources/lib/libRblas.0.dylib \nLAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.4-arm64/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib;  LAPACK version 3.12.0\n\nlocale:\n[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8\n\ntime zone: America/New_York\ntzcode source: internal\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n\nother attached packages:\n [1] clusterperm_0.1.0.9000 gazer_0.1              here_1.0.1            \n [4] pROC_1.18.5            leaps_3.1              randomForest_4.7-1.1  \n [7] devtools_2.4.5         usethis_2.2.3          ggthemes_5.1.0        \n[10] reshape2_1.4.4         boot_1.3-30            crayon_1.5.2          \n[13] gridExtra_2.3          lubridate_1.9.3        forcats_1.0.0         \n[16] stringr_1.5.1          dplyr_1.1.4            purrr_1.0.2           \n[19] readr_2.1.5            tidyr_1.3.1            tibble_3.2.1          \n[22] ggplot2_3.5.1          tidyverse_2.0.0        fdrtool_1.2.17        \n[25] mnormt_2.1.1           ERP_2.2                pacman_0.5.1          \n[28] papaja_0.1.2           tinylabels_0.2.4       knitr_1.46            \n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] remotes_2.5.0     rlang_1.1.4       magrittr_2.0.3    compiler_4.4.0   \n [5] png_0.1-8         vctrs_0.6.5       profvis_0.3.8     pkgconfig_2.0.3  \n [9] fastmap_1.1.1     backports_1.5.0   ellipsis_0.3.2    labeling_0.4.3   \n[13] effectsize_0.8.7  utf8_1.2.4        promises_1.3.0    rmarkdown_2.26   \n[17] sessioninfo_1.2.2 tzdb_0.4.0        bit_4.0.5         xfun_0.43        \n[21] cachem_1.0.8      jsonlite_1.8.8    later_1.3.2       broom_1.0.6      \n[25] irlba_2.3.5.1     parallel_4.4.0    R6_2.5.1          stringi_1.8.4    \n[29] pkgload_1.3.4     estimability_1.5  Rcpp_1.0.12       zoo_1.8-12       \n[33] parameters_0.21.6 httpuv_1.6.15     Matrix_1.7-0      splines_4.4.0    \n[37] timechange_0.3.0  tidyselect_1.2.1  rstudioapi_0.16.0 yaml_2.3.8       \n[41] miniUI_0.1.1.1    pkgbuild_1.4.4    lattice_0.22-6    plyr_1.8.9       \n[45] shiny_1.8.1.1     withr_3.0.0       bayestestR_0.13.2 coda_0.19-4.1    \n[49] evaluate_0.23     urlchecker_1.0.1  pillar_1.9.0      insight_0.19.10  \n[53] generics_0.1.3    vroom_1.6.5       rprojroot_2.0.4   hms_1.1.3        \n[57] munsell_0.5.1     scales_1.3.0      xtable_1.8-4      glue_1.7.0       \n[61] emmeans_1.10.1    tools_4.4.0       data.table_1.15.4 fs_1.6.4         \n[65] mvtnorm_1.2-4     grid_4.4.0        datawizard_0.10.0 colorspace_2.1-0 \n[69] Rmisc_1.5.1       cli_3.6.2         fansi_1.0.6       corpcor_1.6.10   \n[73] gtable_0.3.5      digest_0.6.35     farver_2.1.1      htmlwidgets_1.6.4\n[77] memoise_2.0.1     htmltools_0.5.8.1 lifecycle_1.0.4   mime_0.12        \n[81] bit64_4.0.5"

    "text": "Thanks for stopping by!\nI am currently the Director of the Human Neuroscience Lab at Boston College. My research program investigates the cognitive and neurological underpinnings of language processing, with a particular focus on the mechanisms underlying visual word recognition and speech perception. On the weekends, I turn to my other passion: human memory. In this area, I am especially interested in semantics, metacognition and metamemory, and the role of desirable difficulties in learning. Additionally, I have written on methods and statistics in psychological science, with interests that include intensive longitudinal data analysis (time series), large-team science, non-normal data analysis, and multilevel modeling.\nMy philosophy is that cognition is best understood by examining both behavior and the brain. To gain deeper insights into cognitive processes, I employ a multi-method approach that integrates standard behavioral measurements (e.g., reaction times), eye-tracking, neuroimaging, and physiological and neurophysiological indices (e.g., pupillometry, EEG/sEEG).\nEqually important, my research is grounded in the principles of open science. I am committed to transparency and reproducibility, ensuring that all my work is accessible and replicable."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nRates, percentages, and proportions are common outcomes in psychology and the social sciences. These outcomes are often analyzed using models that assume normality, but this practice overlooks important features of the data, such as their natural bounds at 0 and 1. As a result, estimates can become distorted. In contrast, treating such outcomes as Beta-distributed respects these limits and can yield more accurate estimates. Despite these advantages, the use of Beta models in applied research remains limited. Our goal is to provide researchers with practical guidance for adopting Beta regression models, illustrated with an example drawn from the psychological literature. We begin by introducing the Beta distribution and Beta regression, emphasizing key components and assumptions. Next, using data from a learning and memory study, we demonstrate how to fit a Beta regression model in R with the Bayesian package brms and how to interpret results on the response scale. We also discuss model extensions, including zero-inflated, zero- and one-inflated, and ordered Beta models. Basic familarity with regression modeling and R is assumed. To promote wider adoption of these methods, we provide detailed code and materials at https://github.com/jgeller112/Beta_regression_tutorial."

    "text": "Semantic priming has been studied for nearly 50 years across various experimental manipulations and theoretical frameworks. These studies provide insight into the cognitive underpinnings of semantic representations in both healthy and clinical populations; however, they have suffered from several issues including generally low sample sizes and a lack of diversity in linguistic implementations. Here, we will test the size and the variability of the semantic priming effect across ten languages by creating a large database of semantic priming values, based on an adaptive sampling procedure. Differences in response latencies between related word-pair conditions and unrelated word-pair conditions (i.e., difference score confidence interval is greater than zero) will allow quantifying evidence for semantic priming, whereas improvements in model fit with the addition of a random intercept for language will provide support for variability in semantic priming across languages."

    "title": "Pupillometry reveals a more sustained pattern of effortful listening in older adults",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Listening to speech in adverse conditions can be challenging and effortful, especially for older adults. This study examined age-related differences in effortful listening by recording changes in the task-evoked pupil response (TEPR; a physiological marker of listening effort) both at the level of sentence processing and over the entire course of a listening task. A total of 65 (32 young adults, 33 older adults) participants performed a speech recognition task in the presence of a competing talker, while moment-to-moment changes in pupil size were continuously monitored. Participants were also administered the Vanderbilt Fatigue Scale, a questionnaire assessing daily life listening-related fatigue within four domains (social, cognitive, emotional, physical). Normalized TEPRs were overall larger and more steeply rising and falling around the peak in the older versus the young adult group during sentence processing. Additionally, mean TEPRs over the course of the listening task were more stable in the older versus the young adult group, consistent with a more sustained recruitment of compensatory attentional resources to maintain task performance. No age-related differences were found in terms of total daily life listening-related fatigue; however, older adults reported higher scores than young adults within the social domain. Overall, this study provides evidence for qualitatively distinct patterns of physiological arousal between young and older adults consistent with age-related upregulation in resource allocation during listening. A more detailed understanding of age-related changes in the subjective and physiological mechanisms that underlie effortful listening will ultimately help to address complex communication needs in aging listeners."

    "text": "Listening to speech in adverse conditions can be challenging and effortful, especially for older adults. This study examined age-related differences in effortful listening by recording changes in the task-evoked pupil response (TEPR; a physiological marker of listening effort) both at the level of sentence processing and over the entire course of a listening task. A total of 65 (32 young adults, 33 older adults) participants performed a speech recognition task in the presence of a competing talker, while moment-to-moment changes in pupil size were continuously monitored. Participants were also administered the Vanderbilt Fatigue Scale, a questionnaire assessing daily life listening-related fatigue within four domains (social, cognitive, emotional, physical). Normalized TEPRs were overall larger and more steeply rising and falling around the peak in the older versus the young adult group during sentence processing. Additionally, mean TEPRs over the course of the listening task were more stable in the older versus the young adult group, consistent with a more sustained recruitment of compensatory attentional resources to maintain task performance.

    "text": "Presenting information in a perceptually disfluent format sometimes enhances memory. Recent work examining 1 type of perceptual disfluency manipulation, Sans Forgetica typeface, has yielded discrepant findings; some studies find support for the idea that the disfluent typeface improves memory whereas others do not. The current study examined a boundary condition that determines when disfluency is and is not beneficial to learning to explore this discrepancy. Specifically, we investigated whether knowledge about an upcoming test (high test expectancy) versus not (low test expectancy) helps clarify when mnemonic benefits arise for perceptually disfluent stimuli. In Experiment 1 (preregistered, N = 231), we found that Sans Forgetica is a memory-improving desirable difficulty, but only when there was no expectation of a final test. In Experiment 2 (preregistered, N = 232), we conceptually replicated the Sans Forgetica effect using a cued-recall test. In Experiment 3 (preregistered, N = 232), we ruled out a time-on-task explanation while replicating the results of Experiment 2. Though these data provide some evidence of San Forgetica’s mnemonic benefits, caution should be taken in interpreting these results. Not only were the effect sizes moderate, but low test expectancy may not be realistically achievable in actual educational contexts. Though more research is warranted, we echo our prior arguments that students wanting to remember more and forget less should stick to other, more empirically supported desirable difficulties."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nEye-tracking has become a valuable tool for studying cognitive processes in second language (L2) acquisition and bilingualism (Godfroid et al., 2024). While research-grade infrared eye-trackers are commonly used, there are a number of issues that limit its wide-spread adoption. Recently, consumer-based webcam eye-tracking has emerged as an attractive alternative, requiring only internet access and a personal webcam. However, webcam eye-tracking presents unique design and preprocessing challenges that must be addressed for valid results. To help researchers overcome these challenges, we developed a comprehensive tutorial focused on visual world webcam eye-tracking for L2 language research. Our guide will cover all key steps,from design to data preprocessing and analysis, where we highlight the R package webgazeR, which is open source and freely available for download and installation:https://github.com/jgeller112/webgazeR. We offer best practices for environmental conditions, participant instructions, and tips for designing visual world experiments with webcam eye-tracking. To demonstrate these steps, we analyze data collected through the Gorilla platform (Anwyl-Irvine et al., 2020) using a single word Span-ish visual world paradigm (VWP) and show competition within and between L2/L1.This tutorial aims to empower researchers by providing a step-by-step guide to successfully conduct visual world webcam-based eye-tracking studies.

Similar to results by Hartwig and Dunlosky, we found that high-performing students (relative to low-performing students) were more likely to endorse self-testing, less likely to cram, and more likely to plan a study schedule ahead of time. Independent of achievement, however, achievement goals were stronger predictors of certain study behaviours. In particular, avoidance goals (e.g., fear of failure) coincided with increased use of cramming and the tendency to be driven by impending deadlines. Results suggest that individual differences in student achievement, as well as the underlying reasons for achievement, are important predictors of students’ approaches to studying."

Despite a plethora of standardized measures, few single-word closed-set tests uniformly sample the most frequently used phonemes and use response choices that equally sample phonetic features like place and voicing. The Iowa Test of Consonant Perception (ITCP) attempts to solve this. It is a proportionally balanced phonemic word recognition task designed to assess perception of the initial consonant of monosyllabic consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) words. The ITCP consists of 120 sampled CVC words. Words were recorded from four different talkers (two female) and uniformly sampled from all four quadrants of the vowel space to control for coarticulation. Response choices on each trial are balanced to equate difficulty and sample a single phonetic feature. This study evaluated the psychometric properties of ITCP by examining reliability (test-retest) and validity in a sample of online normal-hearing participants. Ninety-eight participants completed two sessions of the ITCP along with standardized tests of words and sentence in noise (CNC words and AzBio sentences).

In the present, two-part study, 172 college students who had previously completed an online screening survey, including measures of stigma, participated in a single session of group counseling at a mental health clinic.

After, participants completed these same measures along with measures of group relationships. The remaining participants (n = 34; 7 groups) viewed psychoeducation and completed the same stigma measures before being informed of randomization to the waitlist-control condition. Our results replicate and extend findings from Wade et al. (2011): completing a single session of group counseling reduced self-stigma and promoted positive attitudes toward counseling. Further, completing self-affirmation reduced post-session perceptions of public stigma. Self-affirmation had no impact on group relationships. Overall, findings suggest the utility of offering a “try-out” session of group counseling as a stigma-reduction intervention; preceding with a brief self-affirmation intervention provides further benefits by reducing perceptions of public stigma."

    "text": "When exposed to words presented under perceptually disfluent conditions (e.g., words written in Haettenschweiler font), participants have difficulty initially recognizing the words. Those same words, though, may be better remembered later than words presented in standard type font. This counterintuitive finding is referred to as the disfluency effect. Evidence for this disfluency effect, however, has been mixed, suggesting possible moderating factors. Using a recognition memory task, level of disfluency was examined as a moderating factor across three experiments using a novel cursive manipulation that varied on degree of legibility (easy-to-read cursive vs. hard-to-read cursive). In addition, list type and retention interval between study and test were manipulated. Across all three experiments, cursive words engendered better memory than type-print words. This memory effect persisted across varied list designs (blocked vs. mixed) and a longer (24-hour) retention interval. A small-scale meta-analysis across the three experiments suggested that the cursive disfluency effect is moderated by level of disfluency: easy-to-read cursive words tended to be better remembered than hard-to-read cursive words. Taken together, these results challenge extant accounts of the disfluency effect. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed."

In Experiment 2, participants read an educational passage about ground water with select sentences presented in either Sans Forgetica typeface, yellow pre-highlighting, or unmodified. Cued recall for select words was better for pre-highlighted information than an unmodified pure reading condition. Critically, presenting sentences in Sans Forgetica did not elevate cued recall compared to an unmodified pure reading condition or a pre-highlighted condition. In Experiment 3, individuals did not have better discriminability for Sans Forgetica relative to a fluent condition in an old-new recognition test.

In Experiment 3, when participants learned Swahili words with only one type of cue (pictures or English translations) and then estimated which one would be more effective for learning, the majority of participants believed pictures would be more effective regardless of whether they had experienced those cues during learning. Experiment 4 showed the same results when participants had experienced neither type of cue during a learning phase.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Semantic cognition includes taxonomic and thematic relationships, as well as control systems to retrieve and manipulate semantic knowledge to suit specific tasks or contexts. A recent report (Thompson et al., 2017) suggested that retrieving thematic relationships (i.e., relations based on participation in the same event or scenarios) requires more effort or cognitive control, especially when the relevant relations are weak, than retrieving identity relations that are based on sensory-motor features. It is not clear whether the same contrast applies to the broader set of taxonomic relations, which are also based on shared sensory-motor features. In this study we tested cognitive control requirements of retrieving taxonomic and thematic knowledge using a physiological measure of cognitive effort: pupil dilation. Participants completed a semantic relatedness judgement task that manipulated semantic type (thematic vs. taxonomic) and relatedness strength (high vs. low) of word pairs. Cognitive control in the similarity task was examined using task-evoked pupillary responses (TEPRs), as well as standard behavioral measures (reaction times and accuracy). Compared with high-strength relations, low-strength semantic relations elicited larger TERPs, slower reaction times, and lower accuracy, consistent with higher control demands. Compared to thematic relations, taxonomic relations also elicited larger TERPs and slower reaction times, suggesting that retrieving taxonomic relations required more cognitive effort. Critically, our pupillometric data indicated that controlled processing was particularly important for low-strength taxonomic pairs rather than low-strength thematic pairs. These findings indicate that semantic control demands are primarily determined by relatedness strength, not whether the relationship is taxonomic or thematic."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nPerceptual disfluency, induced by blurring or difficult-to-read typefaces, can sometimes enhance memory retention, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To investigate this effect, we manipulated blurring levels (clear, low blur, high blur) during encoding and assessed recognition performance in a surprise memory test. In Experiments 1A and 1B, response latencies from a lexical decision task were analyzed using ex-Gaussian distribution modeling and drift diffusion modeling. Results showed that blurring differentially influenced parameters of the model, with high blur affecting both early and late-stage processes, while low blur primarily influenced early-stage processes. Recognition test results further revealed that high blur words were remembered better than both clear and low blurred words. Experiment 2 employed a semantic categorization task with word frequency manipulation to further examine the locus of the perceptual disfluency effect. Similar to Experiments 1A and 1B, high blur influenced both early and late-stage processes, while low blur primarily affected early-stage processes. Low-frequency words exhibited greater shifting and skewing in distributional parameters, yet only high-frequency, highly blurred words demonstrated an enhanced memory effect. These findings suggest that both early and late cognitive processes contribute to the mnemonic benefits associated with perceptual disfluency. Overall, this study demonstrates that distributional and computational analyses provide powerful tools for dissecting encoding mechanisms and their effects on memory, offering valuable insights into models of perceptual disfluency."

    "text": "Abstract\nIn recent years, there is a growing emphasis on early childhood coding education to equip students with essential skills for a growingly technical society. While emerging research has investigated how text-based programming languages are processed in the adult brain, the neural mechanisms underlying early childhood visual programming languages like ScratchJr remain largely unexplored. This preregistered study examined the cognitive basis of ScratchJr processing, with two primary research aims: 1. Investigate whether ScratchJr elicits neural signatures comparable to natural languages and other rule-based processes (specifically N400 and semantic P600 responses) and 2. Explore how experience level with ScratchJr modulates these effects. We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) from 40 (N = 40) adults while they completed a semantic congruency task using ScratchJr stimuli. Neural responses were analyzed in time bins associated with N400 and P600 components, and experience level with ScratchJr was included as a potential factor to modulate these results. Results revealed a P600 response to semantic violations, with no modulation by experience level. These findings contribute to growing evidence of the semantic nature of the P600 and support the notion that ScratchJr processing evokes neural mechanisms related to structured processes such as natural language."

In this 2-hour workshop, you’ll learn how to set up a fully reproducible workflow to generate a publication-ready manuscript that seamlessly integrates data, R or Python code, text, and references. Special emphasis will be placed on formatting APA-style manuscripts. Additionally, I’ll introduce Nix/Rix as a solution for managing package and system dependencies to ensure long-term reproducibility. | Boston College\n\n            \n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                         Website\n                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                         Video\n                    \n                \n                \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n\nNo matching items"

The function below takes a list of files called file_list and merges all the files together, appends a subject column, creates a trial column using the USER column (GazePoint only allows messages through this channel), creates a time variable (in milliseconds). In the merge_gazepoint function the trail_msg argument requires users to denote a message used in the USER column that references the start of the trial–in our case the START message denotes the start of a new trial. This is a solution by Matt Robinson, but there are other ways one could extract the trial number. What I have done in the past is append a message with the trial iteration (e.g., START_1) in Python and use the separate function to get the trial number.\n\n# A \"monocular mean\" averages both eyes together.

Once we find the blinks we can change the pupil size at that time point as NA and interpolate over it.\nAs a note, the GazePoint does not seem to sample consistently. In this case, it samples every 16 or 17 ms. This is a problem for some other blink detection measures (e.g., the noise based pupil function).

    "text": "An article by Reilly et al. (2019) raised some important questions/issues for the field of pupillometry. One issue that has been bothering me as of late (hence the post) pertains to objectively defining a time window to look at. Although some commonalities exist across the literature, there is no uniform standard for isolating a peak range or delineating the width of this window. In this blog post I present a method we can use to address this issue. To do so, I will be using the example data set from the gazeR package (Geller et al. (n.d.)). This data comes from a lexical decison experiment where participants judged the lexicality of cursive and type-print stimuli."

I do not like these approaches for a few reasons:\n\nThere is a trade-off between power and temporal resolution (smaller time bins) and introducesbias in selection of time bins/windows. There is also the issues of multiple comparisons and autocorrelation\nDoes not take into account individual differences\n\nI wanted to highlight a method I believe is a good alternative: cluster-based permutation tests (henceforth CPT)"

Can't select columns that don't exist.\n✖ Column `X1` doesn't exist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this, we might be tempted to declare a significant difference arisisng ~1500-2500 ms. However, we cannot rely on the graphical analysis and we need a statistical test to be able to affirm that this observation is caused by diffierntial effort between the two scripts.\nPermuation cluster analysis is a technique that is becoming increasingly popular, especially in the cognitvie neuropsychology domain to analyze MEG-EEG (Maris & Oostenveld, 2007). While there exists a number of cluster analysis functions in MNE-Python (Gramfort et al., 2014) and Matlab’s FieldTrip (Oostenveld et al., 2011), what I want to show you is how you can do this analysis in R. The implementation of CPT has not been widely used in pupillometry research. I will hopefully show you that it can be a very useful tool to have in your aresenal.\nBefore I show you how to apply this method, I want to briefly go over the CPT method. The CPT is a data-driven method which increases power and controls for Type I errors across multiple comparisons (exatcly what we need when looking at pupil changes across the time course!). The clustering method involves conducting dependent-sample t-tests for every data point (condition by time). In the first step, adjacent data points that cross the mass-univariate significance threshold (p &lt; .05) are combined to create a cluster. The sum of the t-statistic (or F) are calculated and form the basis for the cluster level statistic. In the second step, a surrogate null-distribution is created by first randomly assigning one of the two conditions within subjects (this is done n times) and retaining the cluster statistic for each randomization. In the third and final step, the cluster level statistic of the real comparison is compared against the null distribution, with clusters falling in the highest or lowest 2.5% considered to be significant.\nWhile writing this blog post, I saw that Dale Barr presented on CPT in the context of eye-tracking. I figured I would take this opportunity to test out the packages he created.\n\ndevtools::install_github(\"dalejbarr/exchangr\")\ndevtools::install_github(\"dalejbarr/clusterperm\")\nlibrary(exchangr)\nlibrary(clusterperm)\n\nThe ‘clusterperm’ package has a pretty nifty aov_by_bin function.

Where are the damn p-values!? What is life? How am I suppose to make an informed decison? What is cool about Dale’s R package is that it has a permutation function that allows you to build the null model and obtain those coveted p-values.\n\ndat_prec &lt;- nest(agg_subject, -subject, -script)\n\nnhds_prec &lt;- cluster_nhds(\n  100, dat_prec, timebins,\n  aggbaseline ~ script + Error(subject),\n  shuffle_each, script, subject) # only use 100 permutations.

I feel much better now!\nFrom this graph we can see that there is one signifcant cluster: from 1900-2500 ms. If you were using this as a more explortatory approach (which I think we should), we know have a time period to look at where we can perform more common tests (e.g., max or mean during that time period). We could alternatively make the inference that a difference between cursive and print-type arises somewhere around 1900-2500 ms.\n\n\nError in `select()`:\n! Can't select columns that don't exist.\n✖ Column `X1` doesn't exist."

    "text": "Thoughts\nThere are some misunderstandings users should be made aware of when it comes to CPT (see Sassenhagen & Draschkow, 2019) for a nice discussion). If we want to ask more specific questions (i.e., at what exact time points effects arise), CPT with a cluster mass correction is not the method to use. We can only be certain that a difference exists; we cannot make claims about whether individual time points show an effect with a given error rate. I think this is more of an issue for M/EEG than pupillometry though. The pupillary signal is very slow.\nOverall, I think CPT can be a very useful tool in determing an appropiate time range to look at, and can even lead to more powerful inferences. Further, the use of CPT obviates the need for multiple comparisons and autocorrelation corrections. However, it does have issues. For instance, it cannot take into account subject and item variability. In addition, it is not able to tell you where within the cluster there is a difference only that there is a difference. And finally, when power is low, clusters may include many false postive time points (Fields & Kuperberg, 2019).\nIn my next blog, I will discuss applying generalized additive mixed modeling to your pupillometry data. I think it might be the perfect soultion!"

This course introduces the latest advances in research methods in psychological science through a series of lectures, tutorials, and seminars. Lectures are generally given by a guest speaker who introduces methodological and statistical issues relevant to psychology research. Students engage in a group discussion with the speaker before the lecture. Tutorials provide students with the necessary skills to build reproducible and transparent research programs. For instance, students learn how to use R, RMarkdown and Git/GitHub, or how to preregister their studies. Finally, students take part in seminars, in which they discuss timely topics in psychological methods (e.g., reproducibility, transparency, pre-registration).\n\n            \n                \n                \n                 Fall 2023\n                \n                \n                \n                 Spring 2024\n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Advanced Statistical Medthods \n                \n            \n            \n                PSY504 | \n                Princeton University\n                \n            \n            As a discipline, statistics has given profound tools to the sciences.
