	abstract = {In the data analysis of functional near-infrared spectroscopy ({fNIRS}), linear model frameworks, in particular mass univariate analysis, are often used when researchers consider examining the difference between conditions at each sampled time point. However, some statistical issues, such as assumptions of linearity, autocorrelation and multiple comparison problems, influence statistical inferences when mass univariate analysis is used on {fNIRS} time course data. In order to address these issues, the present study proposes a novel perspective, multi-time-point analysis ({MTPA}), to discriminate signal differences between conditions by combining temporal information from multiple time points in {fNIRS}. In addition, {MTPA} adopts the random forest algorithm from the statistical learning domain, followed by a series of cross-validation procedures, providing reasonable power for detecting significant time points and ensuring generalizability. Using a real {fNIRS} data set, the proposed {MTPA} outperformed mass univariate analysis in detecting more time points, showing significant differences between experimental conditions. Finally, {MTPA} was also able to make comparisons between different areas, leading to a novel viewpoint of {fNIRS} time course analysis and providing additional theoretical implications for future {fNIRS} studies. The data set and all source code are available for researchers to replicate the analyses and to adapt the program for their own needs in future {fNIRS} studies.},

	abstract = {Pupils respond to three distinct kinds of stimuli: they constrict in response to brightness (the pupil light response), constrict in response to near fixation (the pupil near response), and dilate in response to increases in arousal and mental effort, either triggered by an external stimulus or spontaneously. In this review, I describe these three pupil responses, how they are related to high-level cognition, and the neural pathways that control them. I also discuss the functional relevance of pupil responses, that is, how pupil responses help us to better see the world. Although pupil responses likely serve many functions, not all of which are fully understood, one important function is to optimize vision either for acuity (small pupils see sharper) and depth of field (small pupils see sharply at a wider range of distances), or for sensitivity (large pupils are better able to detect faint stimuli); that is, pupils change their size to optimize vision for a particular situation. In many ways, pupil responses are similar to other eye movements, such as saccades and smooth pursuit: like these other eye movements, pupil responses have properties of both reflexive and voluntary action, and are part of active visual exploration.},
