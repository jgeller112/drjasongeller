## About the course  

Psychological methods keep evolving: psychology researchers constantly adopt new statistical
methods, computational tools, and research practices. This course introduces the latest advances
in research methods in psychological science through a series of lectures, tutorials, and seminars. Lectures are generally given by a guest speaker who introduces methodological and statistical issues relevant to psychology research. Students engage in a group discussion with the
speaker before the lecture. Tutorials provide students with the necessary skills to build reproducible and transparent research programs. For instance, students learn how to use R, RMarkdown and Git/GitHub, or how to preregister their studies. Finally, students take part in seminars,
in which they discuss timely topics in psychological methods (e.g., reproducibility, transparency,
pre-registration).
