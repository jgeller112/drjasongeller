Thanks for stopping by!

I am currently the Director of the Human Neuroscience Lab at Boston College. My research program investigates the cognitive and neurological underpinnings of language processing, with a particular focus on the mechanisms underlying visual word recognition and speech perception. On the weekends, I turn to my other passion: human memory. In this area, I am especially interested in semantics, metacognition and metamemory, and the role of desirable difficulties in learning. Additionally, I have written on methods and statistics in psychological science, with interests that include intensive longitudinal data analysis (time series), large-team science, non-normal data analysis, and multilevel modeling.

My philosophy is that cognition is best understood by examining both behavior and the brain. To gain deeper insights into cognitive processes, I employ a multi-method approach that integrates standard behavioral measurements (e.g., reaction times), eye-tracking, neuroimaging, and physiological and neurophysiological indices (e.g., pupillometry, EEG/sEEG).

Equally important, my research is grounded in the principles of open science. I am committed to transparency and reproducibility, ensuring that all my work is accessible and replicable.
